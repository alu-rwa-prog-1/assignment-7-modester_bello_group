for this class we can use functions such spot getbox to create the boxes which are the grids.

We can use colour function in order to differentiate the boxes either white and black and to also 
enable movement of players.

From this class we can test scenerios of colour of the boxes by using assertEqual to show 
that expected outcome is the same with what we get after running the codes,
