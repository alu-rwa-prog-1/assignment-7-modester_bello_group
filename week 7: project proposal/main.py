For our project we plan on creating a chess game that involves a tournamnet betweenplayers.

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 
64 squares arranged in an 8*8 square grid.

Play involves no hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces:
one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
Each piece type moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn.
The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture.
To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting 
one another.
During the game, play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponent's similar pieces, and finding 
and engineering opportunities to trade advantageously or to get a better position.
In addition to checkmate, a player wins the game if the opponent resigns, or in a timed game, runs out of time.

we plan on starting with our game class that controls the flow our game. It keeps track of all game move, 
which
player has the current turn, and the final results of the game.
we plan creating different classes too to help us in creating functionality and variables of all steps 
required in making the game.
