#in this class we will require functions such as players spot start and spot end to indicate start of movement and end of the movemnt.

#when also use functions to indicate the game status such as active, black-win, white-win, forfeit, stalemate or resegnition.

#we will test scenarios like checking whether expected results such as active if the player is playing.

#we can use assertEqual to show that the player is active and assertNotEqual to show player is inactive.
